Made to work for on OSX 10.8, running mvim with Janus (https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)

Also, made improvements to handling missing files as well as prettifying the output.

Janus sets vim's swap directory to ~/.vim/_temp/.

I'm new to shell programming, so any suggestions/improvements (esp. portability/stability!) are welcome!
